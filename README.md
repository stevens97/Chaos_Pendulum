# Simple Pendulum & Chaos Pendulum Motion

This Jupyter Notebook provides a tutorial of how to numerically calculate the motion of a simple (linear) pendulum, as well as a "chaos" (non-linear) pendulum using Python.

Based on Exercise 3.2, 3.3, 3.6 and 3.7 of Numerical methods for Physics, Garcia (2000).

This code is primarily for educational purposes.

## Prerequisites for using this program:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- math
